# Band-Generator

Welcome to the Band Generator project!

This project marks Day 1 of my #100DaysOfCode Challenge. As part of this journey, I aim to learn, build, and grow my programming skills by working on diverse projects daily.

About the Project
The Band Generator is a simple and fun project that creates unique band names based on user input. It takes information from the user and generates a quirky and creative band name.

Features
User-friendly input prompts
Generates band names dynamically based on user input
A great start to learning basic programming concepts

Why This Project?
Starting small is the first step to mastering anything! This project helps reinforce programming basics, including:

Input/output handling
String manipulation
Creative problem-solving
Stay tuned for more projects as I progress through the 100DaysOfCode Challenge!
